# Policy

## Summary

The London Plan 2021 [@greaterlondonauthorityLondonPlan20212021] was developed by the Greater London Authority and acts as a framework to guide the spatial development of the Greater London Area over the next 25 or so years. All development decisions following the adaptation of the Plan in 2021 should, in theory, adhere to the policies outlined in the document. The Plan covers a range of topics and issues, organized into categories of Good Growth, Spatial Development Patterns, Design, Housing, Social Infrastructure, Economy, Heritage and Culture, Green Infrastructure and Natural Environment, Sustainable Infrastructure and, finally, Transport.

My policy of focus is *G1 Green infrastructure*. The policy states, “London’s network of green and open spaces, and green features in the built environment, should be protected and enhanced,” and that “green infrastructure should be planned, designed and managed in an integrated way to achieve multiple benefits.” [@greaterlondonauthorityLondonPlan20212021]. This policy closely aligns with policies *G5 Urban greening*, *SI4 Manage heat risk*, and *GG3 Creating a health city*. The proper protection and implementation of green infrastructure is critical to mitigating the urban heat island effect and, by extension, reducing heat-related illness in the city.

London is widely considered one of the greenest cities in the world. This fact, however, should not be taken for granted, nor should it be used to gloss over ever-present disparities in access to greenspace and green infrastructure. The “London’s Green Cover” tool available via the [London Datastore](https://apps.london.gov.uk/green-cover/?layers=tree-canopy,green,blue&pos=9.5/51.48800/-0.08750) provides a useful way to visualise the difference in green coverage across London boroughs. While the borough of Bromley sees over 73% green coverage, Tower Hamlets has just over 25% cover [@greaterlondonauthorityGreenCoverMap2024]. Clearly, there is ample opportunity to improve green infrastructure in London, with certain boroughs set to benefit disproportionately. Furthermore, since green spaces are an important mitigating factor against urban heat, increasing green infrastructure in the boroughs with the least coverage is an important step in promoting equitable climate resilience and public health outcomes.

## Applications

Remote sensing stands to significantly assist in the implementation of policy *G1 Green infrastructure* and related goals. As we saw in the practical last week, applying the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to Landsat 9 data was effective in identifying areas of high and low vegetation density. This week, however, I’d like to focus more on remote sensing in the context of the urban heat island effect.

Measuring surface temperature variation across a large study area is central to assessing the extent and intensity of the urban heat island effect in a city. Data from the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) on Landsat 9 makes this possible. TIRS-2 is an advanced thermal sensor that collects data in two spectral bands to detect land surface temperature. The design improves upon the original TIRS on Landsat 8 by providing better measurement reliability and minimized interference (CITE). Both spectral bands of TIRS-2 offer a spatial resolution of 100 meters. This spatial resolution remains small enough to identify localized hotspots in a city. Using this data, it would be possible to visualize surface temperature patterns in London and identify areas where urban heat is most intense.

As we saw, greenness in London is unevenly spatially distributed. The urban heat effect is more pronounced in areas with less heat mitigating infrastructure, such as high-albedo surfaces or tree cover. An analysis of surface temperatures in the city could highlight areas where the urban heat effect is particularly intense. Paired with an NDVI analysis like we saw last week, an approach could be developed pinpoint hotspots characterized by both high temperatures and low vegetation cover, and in turn inform targeted green development. Such a method would work to tackle policies G1, G5, SI4 and GG3 while targeting interventions where they are needed most.

## Reflection

This exercise reminded me of the complexity of urban systems and how closely intertwined policy goals are. In some ways, this interconnectedness simplifies decision-making (for example, enhancing green infrastructure inherently mitigates heat risk and improves public health outcomes), however, it also underscores the challenges of urban planning, where policy priorities may sometimes be in tension and interventions can have unintended consequences. This highlights the importance of a holistic, well-informed approach that considers the full range of urban dynamics before implementing changes. A deep understanding of the city, its policies, and the synergies between them is crucial to ensuring that interventions are both effective and equitable.

While researching this topic further, I came across a heat vulnerability report for London developed in partnership with ARUP [@figueiredoPropertiesVulnerableHeat2024]. Their analysis relies on UHeat, a proprietary digital tool that integrates climate and remote sensing data, including outputs from the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS). Similarly, New York City has developed a [Heat Vulnerability Index](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-features/hvi/), which incorporates factors such as green space access. However, details on their methodologies are limited, making it difficult to assess or replicate their approaches in more detail. This lack of transparency raises concerns about reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for cities with fewer resources.

Nonetheless, these examples illustrate the potential of combining remote sensing techniques to develop useful climate resilience tools. The integration of NDVI analysis with thermal mapping, could offer an efficient way to assess urban heat vulnerability. More broadly, it emphasizes how different remote sensing datasets can be layered effectively. This expands the possibilities for evidence-based urban planning and reinforces the role of remote sensing in shaping climate adaptation strategies.
