  abstract = {One of the objectives of remote sensing is to go beyond simple visual interpretation in order to provide the user with quantitative information for producing documents that conform to cartographic standards and for deriving digital data files compatible with geographical information systems (GIS). In this framework, rigorous geometrical correction is essential. Error sources which introduce geometrical image distortions are related to the platform vector (attitude, altitude, speed), the sensor (distortions, oblique viewing), and to the earth (rotation, earth curvature, ellipsoid, relief). Many methods can be applied for correcting each error separately or for globally correcting the image from all geometrical distortions. This theoretical review has two complementary parts. The first section deals with errors causing deformations on satellite images and related to the platform vector, the sensor and the earth, as well as the mathematical formulation for each error. In the second section, we discuss three different mathematical models which permit overall geometric correction for the entire image from all types of errors of geometric origin. The first is based on the equations of collinearity, the second is based on the equations of collinearity related to celestial mechanics, and the last is based on polynomial equations. Because it takes into consideration parameters related to the viewing geometry of the earth and elements of the orbit, the mathematical model based on the condition of collinearity related to celestial mechanics is the best for topological mapping which requires high precision geometric corrections, while if the image geometry is stable, the earth is flat enough and if the geodetic grid is of good quality, the polynomial methods also provide good results for thematic mapping.}

  abstract = {Although satellite remote sensing techniques have been widely implemented for a variety of applications, using either single or time-series images, few studies have explicitly considered atmospheric effects, and how they can most effectively be minimized. Despite the considerable number of available atmospheric correction algorithms, there is little literature concerning their relative merits. Over water bodies, atmospheric effects account for the majority of the at-satellite measured radiance in the visible bands, and therefore targets of this type provide an opportunity for assessing the effectiveness of the different methods available. This paper reports a study of atmospheric effects and their correction, using multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data for an area to the west of London that includes eight large water reservoirs and a major international airport (Heathrow). Through comparisons of reflectance within a time series of 12 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, the overall impact of atmospheric contributions is shown. The available atmospheric correction literature is then reviewed, and the methods applied to the satellite imagery of the reservoirs. The results are compared with reflectances acquired using a field spectro-radiometer. A critical appraisal of the results, and of problems encountered in applying the various methods, leads to an evaluation of their value in practice.},

  abstract = {Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a ”geobrowser”, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., “land cover”, “water”, “model”, “vegetation”, and “forest”), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many applied problems arising in agricultural monitoring and food security require reliable crop maps at national or global scale. Large scale crop mapping requires processing and management of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a “Big Data” problem. The main objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g., country level) and multiple sensors (e.g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platform are compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory (\textasciitilde 28,100 km\textsuperscript{2} and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that GEE provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platform and providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate and land use/cover change are among the most pervasive issues facing the Southeastern United States, including the Savannah River basin in South Carolina and Georgia. Land use directly affects the natural environment across the Savannah River basin and it is important to analyze these impacts. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the classes and the distribution of land cover in the Savannah River basin; 2) identify the spatial and the temporal change of the land cover that occurs as a consequence of land use change in the area; and 3) discuss the potential effects of land use change in the Savannah River basin. The land cover maps were produced using random forest supervised classification at four time periods for a total of thirteen common land cover classes with overall accuracy assessments of 79.18\% (1999), 79.41\% (2005), 76.04\% (2009), and 76.11\% (2015). The major land use change observed was due to the deforestation and reforestation of forest areas during the entire study period. The change detection results using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicated that the proportion areas of the deforestation were 5.93\% (1999–2005), 4.63\% (2005–2009), and 3.76\% (2009–2015), while the proportion areas of the reforestation were 1.57\% (1999–2005), 0.44\% (2005–2009), and 1.53\% (2009–2015). These results not only indicate land use change, but also demonstrate the advantage of utilizing Google Earth Engine and the public archive database in its platform to track and monitor this change over time.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

In terms of classification accuracy, a combination of these parameters was tested: The Number of Trees (NT), the Variables per Split (VPS) and the Bag Fraction (BF). A total of 450 combinations of different parameters were tested. The highest accuracy classification with an overall accuracy = 89.1\% and Cohen’s Kappa = 0.84 had the following combination: NT = 150, VPS = 3 and BF = 0.1. For classification purposes, a mosaic was created using the median method. The resulting mosaic consisted of all Sentinel-2 bands in 10 and 20 m spatial resolution. Altitude values derived from SRTM and NDVI variance values were also included in the classification. These added bands were the most significant in terms of Gini importance.},

DDM data were first operated with a general data preprocessing procedure, which included noise floor subtraction and normalization. In addition, a simple and effective feature selection (FS) was devised so that the input size was significantly reduced (from 128 × 20 to 20) while the classification accuracy was enhanced. To be specific, the feature was selected as the mean value along the delay-axis (128 in length) at each Doppler bin (20 in all). Here, expected classification labels (sea ice/seawater) were obtained based on reference sea ice concentration data collected by multiple passive microwave sensors. In practice, this trained SVMs-FS algorithm showed improved accuracy but less data storage demands than the existing neural networks (NNs)- and convolutional neural networks-based methods. In addition, the designed FS was also proven to be effective for both SVMs and NNs.},

  abstract = {The sub-pixel impervious surface percentage (SPIS) is the fraction of impervious surface area in one pixel, and it is an important indicator of urbanization. Using remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of SPIS values over large areas can be extracted, and these data are significant for studies of urban climate, environment and hydrology. To develop a stabilized, multi-temporal SPIS estimation method suitable for typical temperate semi-arid climate zones with distinct seasons, an optimal model for estimating SPIS values within Beijing Municipality was built that is based on the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm. First, models with different input variables for SPIS estimation were built by integrating multi-source remote sensing data with other auxiliary data. The optimal model was selected through the analysis and comparison of the assessed accuracy of these models. Subsequently, multi- temporal SPIS mapping was carried out based on the optimal model. The results are as follows: 1) multi-seasonal images and nighttime light (NTL) data are the optimal input variables for SPIS estimation within Beijing Municipality, where the intra-annual variability in vegetation is distinct. The different spectral characteristics in the cultivated land caused by the different farming characteristics and vegetation phenology can be detected by the multi-seasonal images effectively. NLT data can effectively reduce the misestimation caused by the spectral similarity between bare land and impervious surfaces. After testing, the SPIS modeling correlation coefficient (r) is approximately 0.86, the average error (AE) is approximately 12.8\%, and the relative error (RE) is approximately 0.39. 2) The SPIS results have been divided into areas with high-density impervious cover (70\%–100\%), medium-density impervious cover (40\%–70\%), low-density impervious cover (10\%–40\%) and natural cover (0\%–10\%). The SPIS model performed better in estimating values for high-density urban areas than other categories. 3) Multi-temporal SPIS mapping (1991–2016) was conducted based on the optimized SPIS results for 2005. After testing, AE ranges from 12.7\% to 15.2\%, RE ranges from 0.39 to 0.46, and r ranges from 0.81 to 0.86. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach for estimating sub-pixel level impervious surface by integrating the CART algorithm and multi-source remote sensing data is feasible and suitable for multi-temporal SPIS mapping of areas with distinct intra-annual variability in vegetation.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to distinguish and estimate natural forest areas at Paraná, Brazil. Forest plantations (Silviculture) and natural forests have high annual vegetative vigor, as well as agricultural areas in the periods of agricultural harvests, which can bring classification errors between these classes of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), these classes have similar spectral signatures, but have a distinct texture that can be separated in the supervised classification process, with the joining of object and pixel-to-pixel classification method approaches. Thus, image segmentation techniques through Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Machine Learning (ML) made forest mapping possible over a large territorial extension. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to calculate the vegetation indices (VIs) and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) fraction spectral from Sentinel-2 images, and the creation of homogeneous spectrally shaped regions under supervised classification of phytoecological regions and mesoregions. The overall precision obtained in the mappings resulted in 0.94 Kappa Index (KI) and 96\% of Overall Accuracy (OA), which indicates a high performance in large-scale forest mapping. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available on Github (https://github.com/Cechim/simepar-brazil/), creating opportunities for further ad vances in the field.},

  abstract = {In this review, we present the main approaches developed around satellite and airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The great range of SAR imagery applications is summarized in this paper. We organize the most popular methods and their applications in a cohesive manner. SAR data applications are classified into earth observation and object detection applications and the former are separated into land, sea, and ice applications. We present the basic methodologies and recent advances in land cover classification and object detection, as well as techniques for parameter retrieval from SAR data. We give advantages and disadvantages and highlight the particular characteristics of each method. It is shown that usage of SAR contributes to the amelioration of techniques and to the enhancement of reliability.},

  abstract = {SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) is the first open dataset that is widely used to research state-of-the-art technology of ship detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery based on deep learning (DL). According to our investigation, up to 46.59\% of the total 161 public reports confidently select SSDD to study DL-based SAR ship detection. Undoubtedly, this situation reveals the popularity and great influence of SSDD in the SAR remote sensing community. Nevertheless, the coarse annotations and ambiguous standards of use of its initial version both hinder fair methodological comparisons and effective academic exchanges. Additionally, its single-function horizontal-vertical rectangle bounding box (BBox) labels can no longer satisfy the current research needs of the rotatable bounding box (RBox) task and the pixel-level polygon segmentation task. Therefore, to address the above two dilemmas, in this review, advocated by the publisher of SSDD, we will make an official release of SSDD based on its initial version. SSDD’s official release version will cover three types: (1) a bounding box SSDD (BBox-SSDD), (2) a rotatable bounding box SSDD (RBox-SSDD), and (3) a polygon segmentation SSDD (PSeg-SSDD). We relabel ships in SSDD more carefully and finely, and then explicitly formulate some strict using standards, e.g., (1) the training-test division determination, (2) the inshore-offshore protocol, (3) the ship-size reasonable definition, (4) the determination of the densely distributed small ship samples, and (5) the determination of the densely parallel berthing at ports ship samples. These using standards are all formulated objectively based on the using differences of existing 75 (161 × 46.59\%) public reports. They will be beneficial for fair method comparison and effective academic exchanges in the future. Most notably, we conduct a comprehensive data analysis on BBox-SSDD, RBox-SSDD, and PSeg-SSDD. Our analysis results can provide some valuable suggestions for possible future scholars to further elaborately design DL-based SAR ship detectors with higher accuracy and stronger robustness when using SSDD.},

  abstract = {Despite providing vital ecosystem services, wetlands are increasingly threatened across the globe by both anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has emerged as a promising tool for rapid and accurate monitoring of wetland extent and type. By acquiring information on the roughness and moisture content of the surface, SAR offers unique potential for wetland monitoring. However, there are still challenges in applying SAR for mapping complex wetland environments. The backscattering similarity of different wetland classes is one of the challenges. Choosing the appropriate SAR specifications (incidence angle, frequency and polarization), based on the wetland type, is also a subject of debate and should be investigated more thoroughly. The geometric distortion of SAR imagery and loss of coherency are other remaining challenges in applying SAR and its processing techniques for wetland studies. Hence, this study provides a systematic meta-analysis based on compilation and analysis of indexed research studies that used SAR for wetland monitoring. This meta-analysis reviewed 172 papers and documented an upward trend in usage of SAR data, increasing usage of multi-sensor data, increasing integration of C- and L- bands over other configurations and higher classification accuracy with multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR data. The highest number of wetland research studies using SAR data came from the USA, Canada and China. This meta-analysis highlighted the current challenges and solutions for wetland monitoring using SAR sensors.},
